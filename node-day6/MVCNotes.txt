MVC: Model - View - Controller

MVC is an architectural pattern which allows you to maintain structure within your applications.

Model: 
  The model is responsible for the structure and interaction with your data. This is most commonly through a database and a schema of some sort.

View:
  The View is responsible for the visual output of your data. It should contain no database interactions or application/business logic.

Controller:
  The controller ideally is the only place your logic is contained. It drives the interaction of your model, and returns data to your view.
