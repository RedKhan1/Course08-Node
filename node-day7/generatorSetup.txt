How to use express-generator:

Install express-generator globally(use sudo if it doesn't work):
  npm i -g express-generator

To run it:
  express --view=ejs {directoryName}
  express --view=ejs nodeBoilerplate

File structure and purpose:
  app.js: Configuration for express server
  routes folder: folder for routers
  public: static assets folder
  views: folder for rendered pages
  bin/www: contains the process for running the server

Added a script to package.json:
  "dev": "nodemon ./bin/www"

  To run this, type npm run dev. This will start your server in development mode


  Instructions for exercise:
    Make our boilerplate work with our User MVC setup from today's folder. Additionally, make the /users/getUser (a new route, different from /users/getUsers) route display the username on an HTML page

    1 - Connect to mongoDB
    2 - Copy the files
    3 - Register the route
    4 - Test the functionality
    5 - Render the username
