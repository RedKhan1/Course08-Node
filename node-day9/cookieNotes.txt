Cookies:
  A way to preserve data between separate HTTP requests within a browser-server communication.

  Typically used to hold things like user settings, when should a user automatically be logged out. Tracking for where a user was on the website.

To set a cookie(using express):
  res.cookie('cookieName', cookieValue);
  res.cookie('name', 'Jeff');

To clear a cookie:
  res.clearCookie('cookieName') // Clears the first cookie
  res.clearCookie('name') // clears the cookie with name 'Jeff'


Session:
  An additional way to store data between HTTP requests. This does so on the server-side, so whenever the server stops running, you lose all the data that was stored. 

  When using express-session, a session object is tied to the request object and you can refer to them as any sort of key on an object.

  req.session.name = 'Jeff'
  req.session.role = 'Teacher'
